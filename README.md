# HSU Student Snapshots - Shooting Video &amp; Recording Audio

## Workshop
__Shooting Video &amp; Recording Audio__ is a 50-minute workshop to teach and learn how to plan and begin short video projects. Developed by Jesse Garcia, Tim Miller &amp; Christina Cordova

This workshop is a remix of a workshop originally developed by Jesse Garcia. This remix (created by Jesse, Tim Miller, and Christina Cordova) contextualizes Jesse's original workshop to focus on the HSU Student Snapshots project. It is the second in a three-part series to support students in creating short testimonial videos about their experiences as students at Humboldt State University as part of an ongoing project called [HSU Student Snapshots](http://libguides.humboldt.edu/snapshots). You can view the current student video submissions via the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7DUUoET6mUN1jP4pO6uKW9uyubSkQhC). 

Jesse and Christina helped to develop this workshop series as for HSU [SkillShops](http://humboldt.libcal.com/workshops) as [Digital Media & Learning Interns](http://libguides.humboldt.edu/dml/apply) during Spring 2018. The original workshops were offered [March 27](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4048513) &amp; [March 28](https://humboldt.libcal.com/event/4048532), 2018.

## Audience &amp; Scope
This workshop was developed as a quick overview of different options for shooting a testimonial for the Student Snapshots project. The intended audience is individuals who have little to no experience creating a video. It is intended to be a launching off point for someone who has interest in creating a video but doesn't know where to start. The workshop begins with a discussion about setting up a scene and determining what is required to film it. It is not intended to be an exhaustive or authoritative look at video or film production.

## Guide
The guide for this workshop follows the structure of the lesson and can be used as a lesson plan. It provides some basic information as well as a list of resources to help with video projects.
